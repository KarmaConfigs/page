are under these conditions

## Conditions / License
- Anytime the license can get updated, you will need to<br>
accept the new conditions or you will lose all the granted permissions.

- If the class has Private GSA code tag<br>
you won't be able to use that code in another src<br>
until you ask confirmation from GSA, if GSA team<br>
deny the use of that code, you won't be able to use<br>
it, and if you use it, legal actions will be performed.

- Using any code from any class with Private GSA code tag<br>
with the correspondent permission ( GSA allowed you to use )<br>
that code, will require a link to our discord and to [KarmaConfigs](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/karmaconfigs.730858/).

- Modifying the code from any class with Private GSA code tag<br>
is totally forbidden, even with the permission of GSA to use the code.

- The use of code with Private GSA code tag is auto-allowed only by
the plugin that owns it originally, that means neither forks of the
plugin can use the code.

- The use of code with Private GSA code tag is also auto-allowed for<br>
personal projects, yes, that allows you to use the code in any server<br>
you have, always that server is non-comercial (allow prucharses in<br>
the server with real money). If you are selling the server, you must<br>
remove all protected by GSA classes from your plugins if the plugin using<br>
them is not the plugin that owns it originally.

- Editing the code for fixes (allowed only by doing it privately)<br>
will require a revision of a GSA developer, if approved, you will<br>
be mentioned in the code source.
