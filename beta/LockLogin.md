### LockLogin Wiki

## Installing >> Spigot
To install the plugin in spigot is really simple, just drag LockLogin.jar into your plugins folder and load the
plugin with plugin or reload the server

## Installing >> Bungeecord
To install the plugin in bungeecord is more simple that it seems, just drag LockLogin.jar into your plugins folder
of BungeeCord and reload Bungeecord.

You must also drag LockLogin.jar to each of your plugins folder (Spigot server), because if bungeecord is enabled
LockLogin will work as Listener on Spigot, so, if you don't put LockLogin on the servers, the plugin, won't work
as expected.


### WARNING
The actual version is not made for spigot, yeas, you can use it, but most of the events like chatting and other will not
get blocked, use it at your own risk
